There are 1 eigenvalue(s) larger than 1 in modulus 
for 1 forward-looking variable(s)

The rank condition is verified.

warning: Some of the parameters have no value (chi) when using stoch_simul. If these parameters are not initialized in a steadystate file or a steady_state_model-block, Dynare may not be able to solve the model. Note that simul, perfect_foresight_setup, and perfect_foresight_solver do not automatically call the steady state file.
