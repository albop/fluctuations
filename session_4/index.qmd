## The DICE Model

A family of models

- 1992
- ...
- 2018: Nobel lecture
  - video

Many versions: DICE/RICE

## IAM

Integrated Assessment Models

- TODO definition

Two categories:

- policy optimization
- policy evaluation

Optimization can mean two things

- behaviour of competitive markets
- normative point of view

## Preferences

Importance of consumption depends on size of population
Relative importance of different generations :

- social time preference (generational discounting)
- EIS: consuption elasticity

Set based on "observed outcomes"

Consumption is "generalized consumption:"

- traditional market goods
- leisure, health, environmental services...

## Preferences (formalization)

$$W = \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \Psi_t U(c_t, L_t) $$

where $t=2020, 2025, ....$, $R_t=\frac{1}{(1+\rho)^t}$ with $\rho=0.01$ per year

and $$U(c_t,L_t) = L_t c_t^{1-\varphi}{1-\varphi}$$ with $\alpha=0.5$

Nordhaus: it is a "positive" mode: "outcome of market and policy factors as they currently exist"


## Economic Variables (population growth)

Poplulation is exogenous:

$$L_t = L_{t-1} (1+g_{L,t})$$

avec $$g_{L,t} = \frac{g_{L,t-1}}{1+\delta_L}$$

Growth rate decreases over time.
With initial population in 2010, from data

- $g_L(1015) = 13.4$
- approached 10.5 billions in 2100

## Economic Variables (tfp growth)

Poplulation is exogenous:

$$A_t = A_{t-1} (1+g_{A,t})$$

avec $$g_{A,t} = \frac{g_{A,t-1}}{1+\delta_A}$$

Growth rate decreases over time.
With initial population in 2010, from data

- $g_A(2015) = 7.9\%$
- $\delta_A=0.6\%$
- growth rate: 1.9 from 2010 to 2100, then 0.9 from 2100 to 2200

## Carbon Saving Technological Change

Fuel reserves: 6000 billon tons of carbon content
Not binding in the base case

## Total Output

$$Q_t = (1-\Lambda(t))A_t K_t^{\gamma}L_t^{1-\gamma}(1-\Omega_t)$$

- $Q_t$: output net of damages and abatement
- $A_t$: total factor productivity
- $K_t$: capital stock and services
- $\Omega_t$: climate damage
- $\Lambda_t$: abatement costs

Ttranslation "abatement costs"

## The Damage Function

$$\Omega_t = \psi_1 T_{AT,t} + \psi_1 T_{AT_t}^2$$

$$\Omega_t = 0 T_{AT,t} + 0.003467 T_{AT_t}^2$$

where $T_{AT,t}$ is the world temperature.

Assumption: temperature is alone a good measure of damage.

## Abatement cost

$$\Lambda_t = \theta_{1,t} \mu_t^{\theta_2}$$

- $\mu_t$: emissions reduction rates

Total abatement cost is proportional to output

- power function of $\mu_t$: convex ($\theta_2<1$)

## Backstop technology

technology that replaces all fossil fuels

- remove carbon from atmosphere
- zero carbon technolgy
- cost initially high decreasing over time
  - carbon saving technological change

Calibration: 344 per ton CO2 for 100$ removal
- cost decreaases at 0.5% per year

$\theta_{1,t}$ calibrated so as to replicate the backstop price in every year.

## Accounting equations

$$Q_t = C_t + I_t$$
$$c = \frac{C_t}{L_t}$$

$$K_t = I_t - \delta_K K_{t-1}$$

## Projection of CO2 emissions

TODO

## Control Variable

- older versions: emissions control rate
- new verions: carbon tax on carbon price


carbon price: price equals marginal cost of emissions
- from abatement equation, substituting output equations (exercise?)

## CO2 Emissions:

Industrial CO2 emissions:

$$E_{ind,t} = \sigma_t \left[ 1-\mu_t \right] A_t K_t^{\gamma} L_t^{1-\gamma}$$

- $\sigma_t$: carbon intensity, exogenous

$$\sigma_t = \sigma_{t-1} \left[ 1 + g_{\sigma,t}\right]$$

where $g_{\sigma,t} = \frac{g_{\sigma,t-1}}{1+\delta_{\sigma}}$

In the current
specification, σ(2010) is set to equal the carbon intensity in 2010, 0.549 tons of CO2
per $1000 of GDP; gσ(2015) = -1.0% per year; and δσ = -0.1% per five years. This
specification leads to rate of change of carbon intensity (with no climate change
policies) of -0.95%per year from 2010 to 2100 and -0.87% per year from 2100 to
2200.


## Constraint on Carbon Fuel

$$CCum \geq \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} E_{ind,t}$$

- CCUm=6000 tons of carbon content

## Geophysical sectors:

link economy -> climate change

carbon cycle, radiating forcing equation climate chagne claimate damage

all endogenous

total emissions:

- industrial and land-use emissions
 
$$E_t= E_{ind,t} + E_{land,t}$$

Carbon from land-use exogenous and calibrated from IPCC

## Carbon Cycle

From the FAIR model (Finite Amplitude Impulsse Response model by Millar et al. 2017)

Model interactions of carbon "reservoirs" $R^i_t$:

## Climate Equations

<!-- ## Carbon cycle

Three reservoirs:

- $M_{AT,t}$: atmosphere
- $M_{UP,t}$: upper oceans and atmosphere
- $M_{LO,t}$: deep oceans

TODO: system -->

## Warming from radiative forcing


CHECK

$$F(t)   {log2 [ MAT (t) / MAT (1750)]}  FEX (t)$$
$$17$$
$$18$$


## Positive and normative models

Is the model positive or normative?

- ok, for most projection models
- for optimization models
  - it depends

Stern: normative

The ambiguity arises particularly because many models use optimization as a technique for calibrating market outcomes in a positive approach. This is the interpretation of “market mechanisms as maximization or minimization devices.”

## Results

Scenarios:

current policies extended indefinitely
- 2010 policies: 1$ per ton of CO2 emissions reductions

optimal: 
- climate change policies maximize eocnomic welfare
  - full participation
  - no constraint
temparture limit
low discount rate
low time prefrence with calibrated interest rate ()

Paris accord
- high income countries implement emissions reductions

## 1.5 degrees not feasible


## The social cost of carbon


Social Cost of Carbon:

$$SCC_t = \frac{\partial W}{\partial E_t}  / \frac{\partial W}{\partial C_t} = \frac{\partial C_t}{\partial E_t}$$

Show estimates
