# Estimating the price of carbon

## The DICE (family of) model(s)

Nordhaus was rewarded for his work on the DICE model

- DICE: Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy
- several variants (1992, 2016, 2018, 2023...)
  - all available [online](https://williamnordhaus.com/dicerice-models)

## Integrated Assessment Models

Cost-Benefit Analysis

- cost: reduced economic activity
- benefit: damage avoided

. . .

Result is a so-called *Integrated Assessment Model*

- multidisciplinary in essence
- economic models can be reused for the modelisation of costs
- results from earth scientists are incorporated to measure damage




## IAM

TODO

Two categories:

- policy optimization
- policy evaluation

Optimization can mean two things

- behaviour of competitive markets
- normative point of view

## Damages

Damage function $D(T)$ is estimated with engineers/earth scientists

It evaluates the effect of global warming on many systems:

- natural quantitites
    - ex: water temperature, probability of storms...
- production functions
    - ex: crops become less productive

. . .

It differentiates two states for a given system

- __managed__
    ex: a dam on a river, air conditioning, the job market in the US
- __unmanaged__
    ex: a flood, storm, emergency migrations

*Tipping points* -> sudden/irreversible damage

- makes systems effectively unmanageable

## Preferences

Importance of consumption depends on size of population
Relative importance of different generations :

- social time preference (generational discounting)
- EIS: consuption elasticity

Set based on "observed outcomes"

Consumption is "generalized consumption:"

- traditional market goods
- leisure, health, environmental services...

## The Damage Functions


::: columns

:::: column

Results from damage estimation exercises:

- impacts are nonlinear and cumulative
- early studies:  1 or 2 degrees innocuous
- more recent ones: (ex 2018 IPCC report on 1.5)
    - even 2 degrees highly disruptive

In the DICE model damages are market and non-market

- converted in consumption equivalent
- 2% of __permanent consumption__ at 3 degrees
- 8% at 6

## The DICE Model

From Nordhaus Nobel lecture:

$$\max_{c_t} W = \max _{c_t} \int_0^{\infty} U[c(t)] e^{-\rho t} dt$$
$$\text{s.t.}
c(t) = M(y(t), z(t); α, ε(t))$$

::: {.r-stack}

:::: {.fragment .current-visible}

- maximize welfare made of 
    - utility $U()$ of world consumption $c(t)$ overtime 
    - with a time discount $\rho$
- subject to many complicated constraints
    - about 20 independent equations

::::
:::: {.fragment .current-visible}

- this is known as a __Ramsey problem__, a variant of neoclassical growth problem
    - there is a social planner maximizing welfare
    - can also be interpreted as a *positive* modeling of a market without frictions
::::

## Preferences (formalization)

Objective:

$$W = \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \Psi_t U(c_t, L_t) $$

where $t=2020, 2025, ....$, $R_t=\frac{1}{(1+\rho)^t}$ with $\rho=0.01$ per year

and $$U(c_t,L_t) = L_t c_t^{1-\varphi}{1-\varphi}$$ with $\alpha=0.5$

Nordhaus: it is a "positive" mode: "outcome of market and policy factors as they currently exist"


## Economic Variables (population growth)

Poplulation is exogenous:

$$L_t = L_{t-1} (1+g_{L,t})$$

avec $$g_{L,t} = \frac{g_{L,t-1}}{1+\delta_L}$$

Growth rate decreases over time.
With initial population in 2010, from data

- $g_L(1015) = 13.4$
- approached 10.5 billions in 2100

## Economic Variables (tfp growth)

Poplulation is exogenous:

$$A_t = A_{t-1} (1+g_{A,t})$$

avec $$g_{A,t} = \frac{g_{A,t-1}}{1+\delta_A}$$

Growth rate decreases over time.
With initial population in 2010, from data

- $g_A(2015) = 7.9\%$
- $\delta_A=0.6\%$
- growth rate: 1.9 from 2010 to 2100, then 0.9 from 2100 to 2200

## Carbon Saving Technological Change

Fuel reserves: 6000 billon tons of carbon content
Not binding in the base case

## Total Output

$$Q_t = (1-\Lambda(t))A_t K_t^{\gamma}L_t^{1-\gamma}(1-\Omega_t)$$

- $Q_t$: output net of damages and abatement
- $A_t$: total factor productivity
- $K_t$: capital stock and services
- $\Omega_t$: climate damage
- $\Lambda_t$: abatement costs

Ttranslation "abatement costs"

## The Damage Function

$$\Omega_t = \psi_1 T_{AT,t} + \psi_1 T_{AT_t}^2$$

$$\Omega_t = 0 T_{AT,t} + 0.003467 T_{AT_t}^2$$

where $T_{AT,t}$ is the world temperature.

Assumption: temperature is alone a good measure of damage.

graph


## Abatement cost

$$\Lambda_t = \theta_{1,t} \mu_t^{\theta_2}$$

- $\mu_t$: emissions reduction rates

Total abatement cost is proportional to output

- power function of $\mu_t$: convex ($\theta_2<1$)

## Backstop technology

technology that replaces all fossil fuels

- remove carbon from atmosphere
- zero carbon technolgy
- cost initially high decreasing over time
  - carbon saving technological change

Calibration: 344 per ton CO2 for 100$ removal
- cost decreaases at 0.5% per year

$\theta_{1,t}$ calibrated so as to replicate the backstop price in every year.

## Accounting equations

- saving-investment
$$Q_t = C_t + I_t$$
- consumptino per capita
$$c_t = \frac{C_t}{L_t}$$
- law of motion for capital
$$K_t = I_t - \delta_K K_{t-1}$$

## Projection of CO2 emissions

TODO

## Control Variable

- older versions: emissions control rate
- new verions: carbon tax on carbon price


carbon price: price equals marginal cost of emissions
- from abatement equation, substituting output equations (exercise?)

## CO2 Emissions:

Industrial CO2 emissions:

$$E_{ind,t} = \sigma_t \left[ 1-\mu_t \right] A_t K_t^{\gamma} L_t^{1-\gamma}$$

- $\sigma_t$: carbon intensity, exogenous

$$\sigma_t = \sigma_{t-1} \left[ 1 + g_{\sigma,t}\right]$$

where $g_{\sigma,t} = \frac{g_{\sigma,t-1}}{1+\delta_{\sigma}}$

In the current
specification, σ(2010) is set to equal the carbon intensity in 2010, 0.549 tons of CO2
per $1000 of GDP; gσ(2015) = -1.0% per year; and δσ = -0.1% per five years. This
specification leads to rate of change of carbon intensity (with no climate change
policies) of -0.95%per year from 2010 to 2100 and -0.87% per year from 2100 to
2200.


## Constraint on Carbon Fuel

$$CCum \geq \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} E_{ind,t}$$

- CCUm=6000 tons of carbon content

## Geophysical sectors:

link economy -> climate change

carbon cycle, radiating forcing equation climate chagne claimate damage

all endogenous

total emissions:

- industrial and land-use emissions
 
$$E_t= E_{ind,t} + E_{land,t}$$

Carbon from land-use exogenous and calibrated from IPCC

## Carbon Cycle

<!-- ## Carbon cycle

Three reservoirs:

- $M_{AT,t}$: atmosphere
- $M_{UP,t}$: upper oceans and atmosphere
- $M_{LO,t}$: deep oceans

## Positive and normative models

Is the model positive or normative?

- ok, for most projection models
- for optimization models
  - it depends

Stern: normative

The ambiguity arises particularly because many models use optimization as a technique for calibrating market outcomes in a positive approach. This is the interpretation of “market mechanisms as maximization or minimization devices.” 

Explain stuff about ramsey planner

## Results

Scenarios:

current policies extended indefinitely
- 2010 policies: 1$ per ton of CO2 emissions reductions

optimal: 
- climate change policies maximize eocnomic welfare
  - full participation
  - no constraint
temparture limit
low discount rate
low time prefrence with calibrated interest rate ()

Paris accord
- high income countries implement emissions reductions

## 1.5 degrees not feasible


## The social cost of carbon


Social Cost of Carbon:

$$SCC_t = \frac{\partial W}{\partial E_t}  / \frac{\partial W}{\partial C_t} = \frac{\partial C_t}{\partial E_t}$$
